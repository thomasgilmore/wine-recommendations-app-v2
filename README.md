<h1>Wine Recommendations Application Version 2</h1>

<p>I created a Wine Recommendations Application where you can either find a dish that goes well with a given wine (ex. Malbec, Pinot Grigio, Rose Wine, ... etc.). Also you can find a wine that goes well with a food. Food can be a dish name ("steak"), an ingredient name ("salmon"), or a cuisine ("Italian").</p>

<p>For the Wine Recommendations I'm using two API endpoints from <a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a>. I'm using the get dish pairing for wine were you find a dish that goes well with a given wine and I'm also using get wine pairing that finds a wine that goes well with food.</p>

<p>I used React to create the frontend for this project. I used two AJAX calls for the two different API endpoints to return the data to the user and using Netlify to host the app.</p>
